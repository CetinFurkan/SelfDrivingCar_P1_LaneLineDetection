    "1- Region masking is applied according to a four-cornered-polygon which is chosen common for the input files and hard-coded into code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- In real life applications, defined region masking could work on straight rodes. However, for inclinations on the road and on the curves, It should be modified dynamically for each cases.\n",

For the curves, shadows on the road and various road darkness levels, code could be written to be more adaptive to the changes. Also, extra filtering (like Kalman filters) can be used for better results. \n",

Therefore car could be driven according to the closer lane lines but also could understand the next change on the road wheather its a curved or straight road.\n",
